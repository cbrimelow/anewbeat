				<p>A New Beat is an initiative co-founded by the Association of Black Cardiologists and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation dedicated to advocating for women rising as leaders in the field of cardiology. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women. We believe more women in cardiology and ascending to leadership roles will have a tremendous impact on improving care and clinical outcomes not only for women and minorities, but for all patients.</p>
				<p>We are passionate about mentorship and its long-lasting effects on the mentor, the mentee, and all those whose lives are touched thereafter. We encourage male and female pillars in the field to reach out to the next generation to build mutual learn-teach relationships rooted in growth, trust, humility, and respect. </p>
				<p>A New Beat is not only geared to women, but also to men. We are stronger working together, and need input and participation from all groups to help provide the experience and expertise needed to inspire and support more women to rise as leaders in the field. We aim to be a community and resource for women in the field who are interested in advancing their careers while improving patient outcomes.</p>
